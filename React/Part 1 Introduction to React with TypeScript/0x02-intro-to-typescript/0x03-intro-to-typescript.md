Absolutely! Let’s go deep on just that **first part**:

# 🔹 Basic TypeScript Types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`)

In TypeScript, we assign *types* to variables to describe **what kind of data** they should hold. This helps catch mistakes early and improves code readability and maintainability.

Let’s break down the 3 most essential types every React developer must understand **before writing JSX**:

---

## 🟦 1. `string` – Text Values

The `string` type is used to represent **textual data** — anything inside quotes.

### ✅ Example

```ts
let firstName: string = "Favour";
const greeting: string = "Welcome to React + TypeScript!";
```

You can use single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` `` for template literals):

```ts
let fullName: string = "John Doe";
let sentence: string = `Hello, ${fullName}!`; // template string
```

### ❌ Type Safety Example

```ts
let name: string = "Alice";
name = 42; // ❌ Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

---

## 🟦 2. `number` – Numeric Values

The `number` type is used for all numbers — integers, decimals, negative numbers.

### ✅ Example

```ts
let age: number = 25;
const price: number = 19.99;
const temperature: number = -5;
```

You can perform mathematical operations on them just like in JS:

```ts
let total: number = price * 2 + 10;
```

### ❌ Type Safety Example

```ts
let year: number = 2025;
year = "2025"; // ❌ Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

---

## 🟦 3. `boolean` – True/False

The `boolean` type is used when the value is either `true` or `false`.

### ✅ Example

```ts
let isOnline: boolean = true;
const hasAccess: boolean = false;
```

You’ll use this a lot for conditional rendering in JSX.

```tsx
const Message = ({ isLoggedIn }: { isLoggedIn: boolean }) => {
  return <p>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in."}</p>;
};
```

### ❌ Type Safety Example

```ts
let isDarkMode: boolean = true;
isDarkMode = "yes"; // ❌ Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'
```

## 🔍 Recap: Why TypeScript Types Matter

| Type      | Example value       | Used for                           |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `string`  | `"Alice"`           | Names, messages, IDs, HTML content |
| `number`  | `42`, `19.99`, `-5` | Age, price, temperature, counters  |
| `boolean` | `true`, `false`     | Toggles, login status, permissions |

By typing your variables, you prevent bugs like:

* Passing a number where a string is expected
* Forgetting to handle optional values
* Calling string methods on a boolean by mistake

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice

Try this in your code editor (or online playground):

```ts
// Declare the variables with correct types
let username: string = "Dev";
let userAge: number = 30;
let isAdmin: boolean = true;

// Try changing the types to something incorrect
// Uncomment the line below to see the error
// username = 42;
// userAge = "thirty";
// isAdmin = "yes";
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tip: Use `const` When You Can

In most React components, you’ll use `const` instead of `let`:

```ts
const appName: string = "MyApp"; // won't change
let userCount: number = 100;     // might update
```
