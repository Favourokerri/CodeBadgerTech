## **1. What is React?**

---

### üìå Overview of React

**React** is a **JavaScript library** used for building **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications** (SPAs). It was developed by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** and has grown into one of the most popular tools for front-end development.

#### Key points:

* React focuses only on the **view layer** (what users see).
* It allows developers to build **UI components** that manage their own state and logic.
* React can be used with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** for better developer experience and safety.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Component-Based Architecture

React applications are built by composing small, reusable blocks called **components**.

Each component:

* Is a **function** or **class** that returns JSX (HTML-like syntax).
* Can manage its **own data** (state).
* Can receive **data** (props) from parent components.

This approach encourages:

* **Code reusability**
* **Better organization**
* **Simpler debugging**

#### Example structure:

```
<App>
  <Header />
  <Main />
  <Footer />
</App>
```

### üß† Declarative UI and the Virtual DOM

#### üîπ Declarative UI:

Instead of telling the browser *how* to update the UI step-by-step, you **describe what the UI should look like**, and React figures out how to render it.

This makes code:

* Easier to read
* Easier to maintain
* More predictable

#### üîπ Virtual DOM:

React uses a **virtual representation of the DOM** in memory. When state or props change:

1. React creates a new virtual DOM.
2. It compares the new tree with the old one.
3. It **efficiently updates** only the parts of the real DOM that changed.

This makes React very **fast and efficient**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* It uses **components** to break UIs into reusable pieces.
* It encourages a **declarative approach** to UI building.
* React optimizes performance using a **virtual DOM**.
