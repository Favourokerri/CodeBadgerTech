## ✅ Exercise

Try to create errors on purpose, then fix them:

1. Create a component that returns **two elements without a parent** → fix it.
2. Create a prop type but **forget to pass it** → fix it.
3. Try to return an **object** → fix it to JSX.
4. Use **wrong case** on component or prop name → fix it.
