# Creating an HTML File

## What Are File Extensions?

A **file extension** is a suffix added to the end of a file name that indicates the type or format of the file. It helps operating systems and software recognize how to handle or open the file. For example:

- **`.txt`**: Plain text file.
- **`.jpg`** or **`.png`**: Image files.
- **`.html`**: HTML files used to create web pages.

File extensions are crucial because they ensure that the correct application or program processes the file. For instance, a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox will only recognize and render a file as a webpage if it has an **`.html`** extension.

## Importance of the `.html` Extension

1. **Recognition by Browsers**:

   - The `.html` extension signals to the browser that the file contains HyperText Markup Language, which allows the browser to render it as a web page.
   - Without this extension, the browser might treat the file as plain text or fail to open it properly.

2. **Compatibility Across Platforms**:

   - When hosting or sharing files, the `.html` extension ensures that the file is universally recognized as an HTML document, regardless of the operating system.

3. **Organized Workflow**:

   - The `.html` extension helps you identify HTML files easily when working on a project with multiple file types (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, or images).

4. **Essential for Website Hosting**:
   - Many web servers rely on the **`index.html`** file as the default home page. Without the `.html` extension, your web pages might not load properly.

3. **Create a New File**:

   - Click on **File** → **New File** from the top menu.

4. **Save the File with a `.html` Extension**:

   - Go to **File** → **Save As**.
   - Choose a location to save the file (e.g., your desktop or a specific project folder).
   - Enter a name for the file (e.g., `index.html`) and ensure the extension is **`.html`**.
   - Click **Save**.

5. **Write Your HTML Code**:
   - Start writing your HTML code in the editor. For example:
     ```
