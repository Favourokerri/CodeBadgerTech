  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="A beginner's guide to HTML head elements">
  ```

      background-color: lightblue;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
  </style>
  ```

  <script>
    // JavaScript code goes here (We'll explore this later)
  </script>
