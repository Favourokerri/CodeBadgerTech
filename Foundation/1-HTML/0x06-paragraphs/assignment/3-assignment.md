## **Assignment 3: Formatting a Blog Post Using `<hr>` and `<h1>`**  
### **Instructions:**  
1. Create an HTML file named `assignment3.html`.  
2. Add a **main heading (`<h1>`)** with the title of your blog post.  
3. Add **two sections** of text, each inside a `<p>` tag.  
4. Use the `<hr>` tag between the two sections to visually separate them.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- The blog post should have a **main heading** at the top.  
- Two well-structured paragraphs should be separated by a horizontal line.
