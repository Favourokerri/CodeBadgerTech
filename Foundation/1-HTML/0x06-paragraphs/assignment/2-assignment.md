## **Assignment 2: Using `<br>` to Format a Poem**  
### **Instructions:**  
1. Create an HTML file named `assignment2.html`.  
2. Use the `<p>` tag to write a short **four-line poem or song lyrics**.  
3. Use the `<br>` tag to ensure each line appears separately.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Each line of the poem should appear on a new line without starting a new paragraph.  
- The `<br>` tag should be used correctly within the `<p>` tag.
