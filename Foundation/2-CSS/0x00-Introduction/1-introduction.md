# Introduction to CSS

### What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to define the appearance and layout of web pages. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements. By using CSS, the visual presentation of a webpage is controlled separately from its content, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Why CSS?
CSS is important because it enhances web development in several ways:

- **Separation of content and design** – Keeps HTML focused on structure while CSS handles styling.
- **Consistency** – Ensures uniform styling across multiple pages.
- **Efficiency** – Reduces the need for repetitive inline styles, making updates easier.
- **Responsive design** – Adapts layouts for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Improved user experience** – Provides better control over how content is displayed.

### What Problem Did CSS Solve?
Before CSS, web pages were styled using HTML attributes such as `<font>` and inline styles, leading to several issues:

- **Messy code** – HTML and styling were mixed together, making updates difficult.
- **Inconsistent design** – Styling had to be manually applied to each element, increasing redundancy.
- **Lack of flexibility** – There was no easy way to apply global styles or create responsive layouts.
- **Slow development** – Changes required editing multiple elements, making web design inefficient.

CSS solved these problems by providing a structured way to apply styles efficiently and consistently across an entire website.
