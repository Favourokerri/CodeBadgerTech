### Assignment: HTML Page Structure with Comments

#### Objective:

Your task is to write the basic structure of an HTML page. For each element used, add a brief comment explaining the purpose of that element. The comments should help you and others understand why each part of the HTML code is necessary.

#### Instructions:

1. Create the basic HTML structure of a webpage (using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.).
2. For each element used, **add a comment** explaining its function. Each comment should be brief, focused, and to the point.

### Example (Do not copy this directly! This is for your reference):

```html
<!-- This is a comment explaining the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Declares the document type and version of HTML being used -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- The root element that wraps the entire HTML document -->

  <!-- Fill In the rest tags and explain  them with a comment -->
</html>
```

**Key Notes**:

- Write your own HTML structure.
