### **Instructions:**  

1. **Create an HTML file** named `assignment6.html`.  
2. **Inside the `<head>` section, add a `<title>` tag** with the text:  
   - `"About Me - Introduction Page"`  
3. **Inside the `<body>`, include the following elements:**  

   - A **main heading (`<h1>`)** with your name.  
     - The heading should be **blue** and have a **font size of 40px**.  

   - A **subheading (`<h2>`)** that says: `"A little bit about me"`  
     - The subheading should be **green** and have a **font size of 30px**.  

   - **Three paragraphs (`<p>` tags)** describing yourself:  
     1. **Who you are** (e.g., your name, where you're from, what you do).  
     2. **Your hobbies or interests** (e.g., favorite activities, sports, music).  
     3. **Your goals** (e.g., what you want to achieve in life or in your studies).  

   - Each paragraph should have **black text** and a **font size of 18px**.  

4. **Use the `<hr>` tag** to separate different sections clearly.  
5. **Include a closing line using `<p>` and `<br>` tags** to add a friendly sign-off.

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- The **main heading** (your name) appears in **blue, 40px font size**.  
- The **subheading** appears in **green, 30px font size**.

- A **horizontal rule (`<hr>`)** separates sections for better readability.  
- A **final sign-off paragraph** appears neatly formatted with a line break.
