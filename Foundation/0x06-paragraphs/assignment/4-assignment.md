## **Assignment 4: Using the `<pre>` Tag for Code Formatting**  
### **Instructions:**  
1. Create an HTML file named `assignment4.html`.  
2. Inside the `<body>`, add a `<pre>` tag.  
3. Inside the `<pre>` tag, write a **short HTML code snippet** (e.g., a basic structure of an HTML document).  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- The code inside the `<pre>` tag should be **displayed exactly as written**, including spaces and line breaks.
