### Assignment: HTML Structure Practice

#### Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to study and practice the basic HTML structure until you can write it from memory. You will then create an HTML file, name it appropriately, and type the HTML structure inside it.

### Steps:

1. **Study the HTML Structure**:
   Learn the basic HTML structure. This is the skeleton of every webpage. The HTML structure includes the following essential elements:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       <title>Your Page Title</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Take note of the following elements:

   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5.
   - `<html lang="en">`: Specifies the language of the document as English.
   - `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document (e.g., character set, title).
   - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets the character encoding.
   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the webpage is responsive on mobile devices.
   - `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab.
   - `<body>`: Contains the main content of the webpage.

2. **Practice Writing the Structure**:
   Without looking at the reference, try to write the HTML structure from memory. Repeat this several times until you can write it correctly without referencing the example above.

3. **Create an HTML File**:
   After you have practiced the HTML structure, create an HTML file with the following name:

   **Filename:** `my_first_webpage.html`

   Inside the file, type the HTML structure you've just learned.

4. **Save**:
   Save your file with the name `my_first_webpage.html`.

### Deliverables:

- A file named `my_first_webpage.html` containing the correct HTML structure.

### Tips:

- Practice until you're comfortable typing the basic structure without any help.
- Make sure to properly close all your HTML tags (like `</html>` and `</body>`).

Good luck!
