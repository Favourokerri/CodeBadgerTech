### JavaScript Keywords and Identifiers

In JavaScript, **keywords** and **identifiers** are essential concepts to understand when working with variables, functions, and other elements in the language. For now, since we've only covered the `let` and `const` keywords, we’ll focus on those.

---

### Keywords

**Keywords** are reserved words in JavaScript that have special meanings and specific purposes. These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers, because they are part of the language itself.

#### For now, the main keywords we’ve learned about are:
- **`let`**: Used to declare variables that can be reassigned later.
- **`const`**: Used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned once defined (though the values of objects or arrays declared with `const` can still be modified).

#### Example:

```javascript
let age = 25;   // Declares a variable 'age' that can be changed later
const name = 'Alice';   // Declares a constant 'name' that cannot be changed
```

You **cannot** use `let` or `const` as variable names because they are **reserved keywords** in JavaScript.

### Identifiers

**Identifiers** are the names you give to variables, functions, and other elements in your code. Identifiers are how you refer to things you've created, like the variable names you define using `let` and `const`.

#### Rules for Identifiers:
1. **Must start with a letter**, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`). You cannot start an identifier with a number.
   
   - **Good:** `let userName;`
   - **Bad:** `let 1user;` (starts with a number) ❌

2. **Can contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), or dollar signs ($)** after the first character.
   
   - **Good:** `let user_name;` or `let $user;`
   - **Bad:** `let user-name;` (hyphens are not allowed) ❌

3. **Case-sensitive**: As we talked about earlier, `userName` and `username` would be treated as two different identifiers.

#### Example:

```javascript
let userAge = 30;   // 'userAge' is an identifier
const userName = 'Bob';   // 'userName' is also an identifier
```

Here, `userAge` and `userName` are **identifiers** that you use to store and refer to values.

### Important Notes:
- **Keywords are reserved**, meaning you can’t use them as your own identifiers.
- **Identifiers** are names you create for things like variables.
- In JavaScript, we'll be learning more keywords (such as `function`, `class`, and `if`) as we move forward, but for now, we are focusing on `let` and `const` for declaring variables.

---

### Summary:
- **Keywords**: Reserved words like `let` and `const` that have specific purposes in the language.
- **Identifiers**: The names you give to variables (like `userName` or `age`) that follow certain rules.
- We'll be learning more about both keywords and identifiers as we dive deeper into JavaScript!
