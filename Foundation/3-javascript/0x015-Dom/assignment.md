# ✅ DOM Assignment – Build an Interactive Task Tracker

## search what you do not know, that is what makes you  a developer, not knowing everything but knowing how to find things when you need them

## 📝 Assignment Title: **“Interactive Task Tracker”**

### 🧠 Objective:

Apply your knowledge of the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and **event listeners** to build a dynamic, interactive web application without using any external libraries.

---

## 📚 What You Must Build:

You are to create a **Task Tracker Application** that allows users to:

* Add new tasks via an input field and a button.
* Display the list of tasks on the page.
* Mark tasks as "done" (with a visible change like color or strike-through).
* Delete individual tasks from the list.
* Show a live **task counter** (e.g., “Total Tasks: 3”).

---

## 🧩 Requirements:

You **must** use the following DOM techniques in your implementation:

* Select elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, or similar.
* Use `addEventListener()` to attach interactivity.
* Dynamically **create elements** using `createElement`.
* Append elements to the DOM using `appendChild`.
* Modify content and classes using `textContent`, `classList`, or `style`.

---

## 🎨 Bonus Features (Optional but Encouraged):

Choose **at least one** of the following to earn extra points:

* Pressing "Enter" on the keyboard also adds a task.
* Add a category or tag to each task.
* Filter tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks).
* Use `localStorage` to save tasks between page reloads.
* Add an **edit** button to update the task text.

## 🎥 Expected Output (Watch Demo Below):

<video width="600" height="340" controls>
  <source src="./21-47-39.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## 📦 Submission Guidelines:

* Submit only **one HTML file** (`task-tracker.html`).
* Do not use any external CSS or JS frameworks.
* Do **not copy-paste** code from the internet.
* You may use comments inside your code to explain your logic.
