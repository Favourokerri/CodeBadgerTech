# Arrays Assignment (Beginner Level)

### Instructions:

For each task below, use `console.log()` in your JavaScript code to print the requested values to the console. No need to write full functionsâ€”just follow the steps and output the results.

---

### 1. Create and Explore an Array

* Create an array of at least **5 fruits** (your choice).
* Use `console.log()` to print:

  * The fruit at the **first position** (index 0)
  * The fruit at the **third position** (index 2)
  * The fruit at the **last position** (use the array length to find this)
  * The **total number of fruits** in the array (its length)

---

### 2. Add and Remove Elements

* Add a new fruit to the **end** of your array. Use `console.log()` to show the updated array.
* Remove the **last fruit** from the array. Use `console.log()` to show the removed fruit and the updated array.
* Add a new fruit to the **beginning** of the array. Use `console.log()` to show the updated array.
* Remove the **first fruit** from the array. Use `console.log()` to show the removed fruit and the updated array.

---

### 3. Search and Find in the Array

* Use `console.log()` to print the **index** of a specific fruit in your array (choose one fruit that exists).
* Use `console.log()` to print the result of searching for a fruit that **does not exist** in your array (should return -1).

---

### 4. Iterate and Transform Arrays

* Use a `for` loop or `.forEach()` to `console.log()` every fruit in your array one by one.
* Use the `.map()` method to create a new array where each fruit name is in **uppercase**. Print the new array.
* Use `.filter()` to create a new array with only fruits whose names have more than 5 letters. Print this filtered array.

---

### 5. Array Manipulation Methods

* Use `.slice()` to create a new array with a part of your fruits (choose any continuous section). Print the new array.
* Use `.splice()` to remove one fruit from the middle of your array and add a new fruit in its place. Print the updated array.
* Use `.concat()` to combine your fruit array with another array of vegetables (create this array yourself). Print the combined array.
* Use `.join()` to join all fruits into a single string, separated by commas. Print the string.

---

### 6. Advanced Array Checks

* Use `.some()` to check if there is any fruit in the array that starts with the letter "A". Print the result (`true` or `false`).
* Use `.every()` to check if **all** fruits in the array have names longer than 3 letters. Print the result.
* Use `.find()` to find the first fruit that contains the letter "n". Print the fruit found.

---

### 7. Reverse the Array

* Reverse the order of your fruit array using `.reverse()`. Print the reversed array.

---

**Bonus:**

* After completing all tasks, print the **final state** of your original fruit array.
