The tension hung thick in the air, The two parties, eyes locked and muscles taut, stood on the precipice of conflict, fully prepared, they were like coiled serpents ready to strike if given the Go ahead. 

"Would you both tell your dogs to stand down" King Alaric said calmly after getting a good sip of the glass of wine in his hands.

"Stand down men" Eldrin commanded, his gazed fixed on Balthazar while his hands continued playing with the Mabel's in his hands

"As his solders yielded to his command, Balthazar's men slowly put away their swords too"

"If this is true Balthazar, then we can not allow you lead this order" King Celestian quickly shipped in his thoughts

"Why? what's so wrong in harboring the so called witches?" Alaric cuts in "Once their god was destroyed, they were completely stripped of their powers as written in the ancient scrolls. They are just humans as far as I am concerned"

Celestian’s irritation was palpable as he leaned in, his eyes narrowing. “And how, pray tell, do you come by such knowledge?” he demanded, his voice edged with suspicion.

"It is written in the ancient scrolls which everyone who is literate was supposed to know, even the women at the market square know about this fact just by hearing from mouth to mouth. You would had known if you had put down your head to read instead of playing politics " Alaric reply shot anger straight into Celestian's bone

"Lets not start another fight" Eldrin quickly cuts in to prevent Celestian from expressing his anger. "While you are right about they being stripped of their powers, it is also written that within them, There is a god mother. A woman who carries the very last power of their god, and it has been said that this power is passed from generation to generation to their chosen successor "

"That is a mirth for all we know. No proven data to back that statement" Alaric quickly replied.

"What if it was no mirth. And she rises and curse our lands. That would be a terrible consequence we will all have to face because of this drastic action."

"If Balthazar must be the Godhead" Eldrin continues " which of course he is a perfect fit for considering his large army, he must get rid of all the witches in his kingdom. mother or child, capable of black magic or not doesn't matter. We have to cleanse this world from their flit" Eldrin’s expression shifted, a blend of cunning and determination etching lines across his weathered face

"What is it going to  be Balthazar, would you kill them, or give up the Godhead position?" Eldrin asked, directing his gaze to king Balthazar who stood still, capturing and processing words that sipped into his ears

King Balthazar’s chest tightened, the weight of Eldrin’s words pressing upon him like a leaden crown. His grip tightened on edge of the table, to give up the Godhead position, to relinquish the very essence of his authority over the three kingdoms was unthinkable. It would be a surrender, a defeat that echoed through the annals of history. Eldrin’s challenge was not just about the witches, it was a battle for dominance, a clash of wills that threatened to unravel the very fabric of their kingdom. Balthazar’s jaw clenched, and he straightened, drawing upon the remnants of his regal composure.

“The witches,” Balthazar spoke, “are but pawns in a grander game. Their fate matters little. I will kill them all if that would give you the assurance you need. Its not like I care about them" Balthazar words were not his own, but of pride that sat in the dark corners of his heart"

“When I return, I shall unleash a tempest of ice, a hailstorm of swords, and a deluge of arrows upon them. None shall escape the wrath that follows.” Balthazar's eyes gleamed with a fierce determination, and the air seemed to thicken, as if anticipating the impending storm.

"But your majesty, you cannot do this....." Edward said very swiftly, his voice carrying the weight of surprise.

"Silence" Balthazar screamed, cutting Edward short, he could not let go of the Godhead position for a matter as trivial as this.

"Your majesty" Edward continued, kneeling down in front of the king. "I beg of you, my wife, my daughter are of witches lineage, they both carry the birth mark of Hertilous"

"Then they shall die, Including yourself. Seize him" Balthazar gave commands.

Balthazar’s command hung in the air like a blade poised to strike. His soldiers moved to seize Edward. Edward was no fool, he could not stay still and die or let his family die because of the pride of some king. With a swift grace, he drew his sword, the blade gleaming like moonlight on water.  His blade sliced the fingers of one of the men who tried to seize him, sending a sharp cry out of the soldiers mouth, he swiftly ran away, bursting through the castle door, adrenaline urging him forward. The heavy oak panels groaned as he pushed them open with the speed of light.

Behind him, five soldiers thundered out of the castle, their armor clanking. Eldrin’s heart raced, he had to lose them. He sprinted toward the stables, the scent of hay and horses filling his nostrils. His boots slipped on the slicked ground, but he regained his balance.

The stable doors loomed ahead. Eldrin flung them open, startling the horses within. They whinnied and stamped, eyes wide with fear. Eldrin’s gaze darted around. There the black stallion, strong and swift. He leaped onto its back, the reins in his hands, and kicked the horse into a gallop. 

Hooves thundered against the earth as Eldrin rode through the castle gates. Eldrin urged the horse toward the forest to avoid easy trailing. The trees loomed, their branches clawing at the sky. He ducked low, the leaves brushing his face, He rode deeper into the woods, his family’s safety depended on him now

"Wise decision king of the North. We believe you will stand firm on your word as A king supposed to" Eldrin  said and quickly took his seat with a smile of satisfaction all over his face.

"This is nothing but a foolish decision. Unnecessary blood shed. You are willing to stain your land with the blood of the innocent just to be the Godhead?" Alaric asked, he was so displeased with Balthazar's decision.

"Oh shut up, you self righteous prick" Celestian cuts in. "The witches plagued our lands for decades. Soldiers died, women and children fell, the white sickness took  half of our lands and you speak of innocence"

"That was long, long, long ago. All the perpetuators are dead. You are only going to exterminate people that did not even take part in the siege" Alaric defended

"You do not seem to understand" Eldrin cuts in "They will rise up gain, they always do. We cannot let what happened many years ago repeat it self. Its called taking precaution Alaric. Besides, Balthazar is the one who wants to carry out what you see as atrocity, and he has no problem with it. So why the barking? "

"Well, not my people, not my concern. But I employ you to think and reconsider your decision, Godhead" Alaric said to Balthazar while taking a bow.

"Since my business here is settled I shall take my leave now before Edward dose something drastic" Balthazar said as he motioned towards the exit.

"Well, make sure you tame your dog your kingliness, we will not...."

Before Eldrin could complete his statement, Balthazar had already given a subtle signal to one of his men. Swift and precise, the enforcer lunged at Eldrin, pinning him down on the table. One powerful hand gripped Eldrin's wrist, twisting his arm behind his back, while the other hand pressed his head firmly against the cold, wooden surface. Eldrin's words were cut off abruptly, replaced by a muffled grunt of surprise and pain.

The southern soldiers drew their swords and they charged towards the direction where Eldrin was pinned

"You will put away your swords" Alaric roared stopping the soldiers mid way. "You are in the presence of the Godhead, you will not move a muscle except your king Eldrin tells you to, and he must get his commands from the Godhead"

"Put down your swords, now" Eldrin commanded while still pinned down and his soldiers yielded

"You are nothing but a mere lord in my presence now, you should address me with more respect" Balthazar said, waving his hands for his soldier to stand at ease.

"Of course you majesty" Eldrin replied,  rubbing his wrist, "But you will only be acknowledged as Godhead  if you tear down the witches"

"And I intend to do just that," Balthazar replied, his eyes burning with fury as he and his entourage stormed out of the castle.




Williams rode on his white horse for a couple of days. Though he did not have the head of Edward as the king had requested, but he felt confident that Balthazar would listen to reason and understand his explanation.

As Williams approached, he saw the impressive sight of King Balthazar's chariot. The chariot was grand and imposing, adorned with intricate designs and gilded details that showcased the king's wealth and power. It stood out prominently among the fleet.

Soldiers marched in disciplined formations both ahead of and behind the chariot, their armor glinting in the sunlight. The rhythmic sound of their marching feet created an air of solemnity and order. The soldiers in front cleared the path and announced the king's presence, while those behind formed a protective phalanx, ensuring the king's safety and command.

Williams hopped down his horse, and walked towards the window of the chariot. King Balthazar slides open his window, looking at Williams with eyes that roared "I would not be surprised if you failed"

Well? I see no head" Balthazar's voice dripped with scorn as he spoke. His eyes narrowed, and his lips curled into a sneer.

"You majesty, I deeply regret not being able to bring back his head. I underestimated him and he bested us. At your command I would take four  men and go ahead once more and this time I will not fail"

"You will fail a thousand times even if I give you my whole army. You need four men? how many did I give you when you left?"

"Three Your majesty" Williams quickly replied.

"I gave you three men, three standing men, to bring back the head of one. You failed, and now you come back to me, speaking of regrets as though it were a balm for failure. Don't you find it amusing? you left with three men, they lost their heads, you came back with buries on your mouth and now you seek four men. So are you saying you lost to a man who cannot even use any element  because you were  one man short?"

"No your majesty. it was....."

"Oh shut up" King Balthazar cuts in very fiercely. "Your stupid failure will make him get to the capital a day before us. That's plenty of time to flee and warn the others. If I had asked Edward to bring back your head, it would be in a sack before I would be able to say the word dig. Its quite a shame to lose a man like him, its the good ones that always end up in the wrong side of the sword, I wonder why the bad ones like yourself are left out."

"I thought you could fill the shoes of Edward, but that would not be possible since they are too heavy to carry"

"Your majesty, no, I can do this," Williams replied, his voice steady despite the harsh reprimand

"Oh silence" Balthazar roared. "I would rather let maggots eat me alive than let you be my hand. As a matter of fact, from this day onwards you are no longer a member of the kings guard."

"You" Balthazar called loudly, pointing to one of is soldiers carrying the kingdoms flag. "Hand him the banner you hold. He is nothing more than a mere a soldier"

The soldier quickly placed the flags in Williams hands. "Here you go dog. March with your feet, your days of horses are over" The soldier whispered as he handed the flag to Williams

As the flag was thrust into his hands, anger surged through Williams, filling his heart with a burning fury. His jaw clenched, and his knuckles turned white as he gripped the banner tightly. The humiliation of being stripped of his title and demoted to a mere soldier stung deeply. Balthazar's scornful words echoed in his mind, each one a dagger to his pride.

Williams' mind raced with a mix of indignation and determination. He had always been loyal to the king, and this public shaming felt like a betrayal. The soldier's mocking words, "Here you go, dog..." only fueled the fire within him. 

Despite the seething anger, Williams knew he had to control his emotions. He stood tall, holding the banner with a fierce resolve. This was not the end for him. He would prove his worth and regain his honor, no matter the cost.

"Move faster, you sacks of bones!" Balthazar shouted, his voice filled with irritation. "Has the heat of the south made you all weak? March faster, and embrace the cold of the north! I have heads to take and a throne to ascend"


Back in the south, Eldrin and Celestian Starforge stood alone in a grand hall. The room was vast and echoing, with high ceilings and ornate decorations that spoke of the kingdom's rich history. Eldrin absentmindedly rolled two marbles in his hand, the smooth stones clicking softly against each other. His expression was contemplative, eyes fixed on a distant point as he considered the weight of their situation.

Celestian Starforge, equally regal and commanding, stood beside him, his arms crossed and his face set in a determined gaze.

"Why do you like marbles so much Eldrin?" Celestian asked

"A lot of people wonder why I always hold them. You could say its a bad habit. I just love the smooth touch of it, and those tiny sounds they make, sounds like music in my ears. But I do not believe you came back to these walls to talk about marbles"

"Certainly not," Celestian quickly replied. "Your wife and child I've not seen them. One might almost believe you live alone."

"Most kings build their chambers at the top of their castles, but I chose differently," Eldrin responded, a faint smile on his lips. "Like the rabbits, I built mine below. My wife is beneath this castle, where I know she's safe."

"I do not think we care about each other so much that my families where about becomes a concern to you. Why are you really here?" Eldrin asked with a serious gaze

"It is about the last meeting. What happened was not what we planned" Celestian returned the gaze

"And what did we plan exactly?" Eldrin asked

"You left a great deal of the details, but we certainly did not agree to letting Balthazar walk out with the title" Celestian quickly replied

"He is not really the Godhead yet, he still has to...."

"Has to what?" Celestian cuts in sharply. "Do you think killing those witches would be something Balthazar would not do? They worth nothing to him, we cannot even call them witches anymore more, no one has been able to use black magic for ages"

"Certainly not, Killing those witches, is the very pit dogged for him, if he should fall in, the Godhead position will be out of reach for him.  For my plan to work, the witches have to get out of the way, they are a very big hindrance to me" Eldrin replied

Celestian's face was decorated with confusion. "I am speechless. What do you want with the witches death?"

"Many things king Celestian of the west, many things. The day the witches fall, That day will be the beginning of my rise. Have you ever heard of the Book of Yoko?"

Celestian straightened, his eyes narrowing with sudden intensity. "Of course I have. What about it?" His voice carried a tone of cautious curiosity, the weight of the ancient tome's legend not lost on him.

"Yoko, is the god the witches pray too. They stole something from this world using Yoko's power, what they stole is written in the book along side what to do  to get it back"

"What did they steal? and even if what they stole was so powerful, the Yoko's book has not been seen by anyone" Celestian replied softly

"You make me laugh," Eldrin said with a devilish smile. "The book has passed through many hands. As for what they stole, some call it Terror. To most, it is indeed terror, but to those who wield it, it is power."

"I cannot tell you more than this my friend" Eldrin continues "But, Balthazar has to become the Godhead to lose it"
