The tension hung thick in the air, The two parties, eyes locked and muscles taut, stood on the precipice of conflict, fully prepared, they were like coiled serpents ready to strike if given the Go ahead. 

"Would you both tell your dogs to stand down" King Alaric said calmly after getting a good sip of the glass of wine in his hands.

"Stand down men" Eldrin commanded, his gazed fixed on Balthazar while his hands continued playing with the Mabel's in his hands

"As his solders yielded to his command, Balthazar's men slowly put away their swords too"

"If this is true Balthazar, then we can not allow you lead this order" King Celestian quickly shipped in his thoughts

"Why? what's so wrong in harboring the so called witches?" Alaric cuts in "Once their god was destroyed, they were completely stripped of their powers as written in the ancient scrolls. They are just humans as far as I am concerned"

Celestian’s irritation was palpable as he leaned in, his eyes narrowing. “And how, pray tell, do you come by such knowledge?” he demanded, his voice edged with suspicion.

"It is written in the ancient scrolls which everyone who is literate was supposed to know, even the women at the market square know about this fact just by hearing from mouth to mouth. You would had known if you had put down your head to read instead of playing politics " Alaric reply shot anger straight into Celestian's bone

"Lets not start another fight" Eldrin quickly cuts in to prevent Celestian from expressing his anger. "While you are right about they being stripped of their powers, it is also written that within them, There is a god mother. A woman who carries the very last power of their god, and it has been said that this power is passed from generation to generation to their chosen successor "

"That is a mirth for all we know. No proven data to back that statement" Alaric quickly replied.

"What if it was no mirth. And she rises and curse our lands. That would be a terrible consequence we will all have to face because of this drastic action."

"If Balthazar must be the Godhead" Eldrin continues " which of course he is a perfect fit for considering his large army, he must get rid of all the witches in his kingdom. mother or child, capable of black magic or not doesn't matter. We have to cleanse this world from their flit" Eldrin’s expression shifted, a blend of cunning and determination etching lines across his weathered face

"What is it going to  be Balthazar, would you kill them, or give up the Godhead position?" Eldrin asked, directing his gaze to king Balthazar who stood still, capturing and processing words that sipped into his ears

King Balthazar’s chest tightened, the weight of Eldrin’s words pressing upon him like a leaden crown. His grip tightened on edge of the table, to give up the Godhead position, to relinquish the very essence of his authority over the three kingdoms was unthinkable. It would be a surrender, a defeat that echoed through the annals of history. Eldrin’s challenge was not just about the witches, it was a battle for dominance, a clash of wills that threatened to unravel the very fabric of their kingdom. Balthazar’s jaw clenched, and he straightened, drawing upon the remnants of his regal composure.

“The witches,” Balthazar spoke, “are but pawns in a grander game. Their fate matters little. I will kill them all if that would give you the assurance you need. Its not like I care about them" Balthazar words were not his own, but of pride that sat in the dark corners of his heart"

“When I return, I shall unleash a tempest of ice, a hailstorm of swords, and a deluge of arrows upon them. None shall escape the wrath that follows.” Balthazar's eyes gleamed with a fierce determination, and the air seemed to thicken, as if anticipating the impending storm.

"But your majesty, you cannot do this....." Edward said very swiftly, his voice carrying the weight of surprise.

"Silence" Balthazar screamed, cutting Edward short, he could not let go of the Godhead position for a matter as trivial as this.

"Your majesty" Edward continued, kneeling down in front of the king. "I beg of you, my wife, my daughter are of witches lineage, they both carry the birth mark of Hertilous"

"Then they shall die, Including yourself. Seize him" Balthazar gave commands.

Balthazar’s command hung in the air like a blade poised to strike. His soldiers moved to seize Edward. Edward was no fool, he could not stay still and die or let his family die because of the pride of some king. With a swift grace, he drew his sword, the blade gleaming like moonlight on water.  His blade sliced the fingers of one of the men who tried to seize him, sending a sharp cry out of the soldiers mouth, he swiftly ran away, bursting through the castle door, adrenaline urging him forward. The heavy oak panels groaned as he pushed them open with the speed of light.

Behind him, five soldiers thundered out of the castle, their armor clanking. Eldrin’s heart raced, he had to lose them. He sprinted toward the stables, the scent of hay and horses filling his nostrils. His boots slipped on the slicked ground, but he regained his balance.

The stable doors loomed ahead. Eldrin flung them open, startling the horses within. They whinnied and stamped, eyes wide with fear. Eldrin’s gaze darted around. There the black stallion, strong and swift. He leaped onto its back, the reins in his hands, and kicked the horse into a gallop. 

Hooves thundered against the earth as Eldrin rode through the castle gates. Eldrin urged the horse toward the forest to avoid easy trailing. The trees loomed, their branches clawing at the sky. He ducked low, the leaves brushing his face, He rode deeper into the woods, his family’s safety depended on him now

"Wise decision king of the North. We believe you will stand firm on your word as A king supposed to" Eldrin  said and quickly took his seat with a smile of satisfaction all over his face.

"This is nothing but a foolish decision. Unnecessary blood shed. You are willing to stain your land with the blood of the innocent just to be the Godhead?" Alaric asked, he was so displeased with Balthazar's decision.

"Oh shut up, you self righteous prick" Celestian cuts in. "The witches plagued our lands for decades. Soldiers died, women and children fell, the white sickness took  half of our lands and you speak of innocence"

"That was long, long, long ago. All the perpetuators are dead. You are only going to exterminate people that did not even take part in the siege" Alaric defended

"You do not seem to understand" Eldrin cuts in "They will rise up gain, they always do. We cannot let what happened many years ago repeat it self. Its called taking precaution Alaric. Besides, Balthazar is the one who wants to carry out what you see as atrocity, and he has no problem with it. So why the barking? "

"Well, not my people, not my concern. But I employ you to think and reconsider your decision, Godhead" Alaric said to Balthazar while taking a bow.

"Since my business here is settled I shall take my leave now before Edward dose something drastic" Balthazar said as he motioned towards the exit.

"Well, make sure you tame your dog your kingliness, we will not...."

Before Eldrin could complete his statement, Balthazar had already given a subtle signal to one of his men. Swift and precise, the enforcer lunged at Eldrin, pinning him down on the table. One powerful hand gripped Eldrin's wrist, twisting his arm behind his back, while the other hand pressed his head firmly against the cold, wooden surface. Eldrin's words were cut off abruptly, replaced by a muffled grunt of surprise and pain.

The southern soldiers drew their swords and they charged towards the direction where Eldrin was pinned

"You will put away your swords" Alaric roared stopping the soldiers mid way. "You are in the presence of the Godhead, you will not move a muscle except your king Eldrin tells you to, and he must get his commands from the Godhead"

"Put down your swords, now" Eldrin commanded while still pinned down and his soldiers yielded

"You are nothing but a mere lord in my presence now, you should address me with more respect" Balthazar said, waving his hands for his soldier to stand at ease.

"Of course you majesty" Eldrin replied,  rubbing his wrist, "But you will only be acknowledged as Godhead  if you tear down the witches"

"And I intend to do just that," Balthazar replied, his eyes burning with fury as he and his entourage stormed out of the castle.
