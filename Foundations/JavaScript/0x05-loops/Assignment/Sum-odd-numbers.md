### Problem: **Sum of Odd Numbers**

#### Problem Statement:
Write a program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. 

1. First, check if `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `n` is not positive (i.e., `n` is less than or equal to 0), print "The number must be a positive number."
   - If `n` is positive, proceed to the next steps.
   
2. Use a loop to go through all numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. Check if each number is odd.

4. Add all the odd numbers together.

5. Print the total sum of the odd numbers.

#### Example:
- If `n` is set to **10**, the output should be:
  ```
  Sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10: 25
  ```

- If `n` is set to **-5**, the output should be:
  ```
  The number must be a positive number.
  ```
