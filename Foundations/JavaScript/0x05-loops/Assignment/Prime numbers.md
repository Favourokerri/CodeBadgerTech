### Problem: **Prime Numbers from 1 to 100**

#### Problem Statement:
Write a program that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and is divisible only by 1 and itself.

#### Requirements:
1. Use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Use a nested loop or an alternative method to check whether each number is prime.
3. Use `if` statements and logical operators to handle the decision-making process (whether a number is prime or not).

#### Example Output:
```
Prime numbers between 1 and 100 are: 
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
```
