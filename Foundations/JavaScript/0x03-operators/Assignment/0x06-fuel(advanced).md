## 6. **Fuel Efficiency Calculator**
---
Imagine you have driven a certain number of miles and want to know how many gallons of fuel you’ve used. You know the car’s fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon. Write a program to find out how much fuel you’ve used if you’ve driven 300 miles. Make sure to print out the distance driven and the gallons of fuel used in a clear sentence.

**Expected Output**:
```
If you've driven 300 miles, you've used 12 gallons of fuel.
