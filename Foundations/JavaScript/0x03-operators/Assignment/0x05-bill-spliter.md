**Task**:  
Create variables for the total bill amount (e.g., `let totalBill = 250`) and the number of people splitting the bill (e.g., `let numberOfPeople = 5`). Calculate how much each person should pay. Use `console.log()` to print the total bill and how much each person has to contribute.

**Expected Output**:
```
The total bill is $250. Each person needs to pay $50.00.
```
