# Days to Hours, Minutes, and Seconds Converter.

## Objective: Practice using arithmetic operators and variables.

---
### Task: Create variables for a number of days (e.g., let days = 3) 
and calculate how many hours, minutes, and seconds that is in that number of days. 
Use console.log() to print the result in a single sentence.

---
Hint: 1 day = 24 hours, 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 60 seconds.

your output should look like:
there are 200 hours, 9000 minutes, and 60000 seconds in 4days
