### Simple Interest Calculator

---
**Task**:  
Create variables for principal (e.g., `let principal = 1000`), rate of interest (e.g., `let rate = 5`), and time in years (e.g., `let time = 3`). Calculate the **simple interest** using the formula:  
`Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100`  
Print the principal, rate, time, and calculated interest in one sentence.

**Expected Output**:
```
For a principal of $1000 at an interest rate of 5% for 3 years, the simple interest is $150.
```
