## 2. Circle Area and Circumference Calculator
---
**Task**:  
Create a variable for the radius of a circle (e.g., `let radius = 7`). Calculate the **area** and **circumference** using the following formulas:
- Area: `π * radius * radius`  
- Circumference: `2 * π * radius`

Print the radius, area, and circumference in a single sentence.

**Expected Output**:
```
For a circle with radius 7: Area is 153.94, Circumference is 43.98.
```
