# JavaScript Scheme of Work

## Overview

This scheme of work is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of JavaScript and gradually build their knowledge and skills. The course is divided into 10 modules, each consisting of 2-3 lessons. Each module covers a specific aspect of JavaScript, from the basics to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.

The overall objective is for students to gain a solid understanding of JavaScript and its practical applications in web development.

## **Course Structure**

### **Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript**
#### Lesson 1: JavaScript Overview
- What is JavaScript? (History, role in web development)
- How JavaScript integrates with HTML and CSS
- Introduction to browsers’ developer tools
- Setting up a development environment

**Practical Task**: Add basic inline JavaScript to an HTML file to create a simple alert box.

#### Lesson 2: JavaScript Syntax and Basics
- Variables (var, let, const)
- Data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined)
- Comments
- Basic input/output (alert, console.log, prompt)

**Practical Task**: Write a script that prompts the user for their name and greets them in the console.

---

### **Module 2: JavaScript Operators and Control Flow**
#### Lesson 1: Operators
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
- Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)

**Practical Task**: Create a simple calculator using prompt and alert to handle user input.

#### Lesson 2: Control Flow and Conditional Statements
- If, else if, and else statements
- Ternary operators
- Switch statements

**Practical Task**: Write a script that asks the user for their age and returns different responses based on their age group.

---

### **Module 3: Loops and Iteration**
#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Loops
- While loop
- Do-while loop
- For loop

**Practical Task**: Create a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using different types of loops.

#### Lesson 2: Loop Control (break, continue)
- Break statement
- Continue statement

**Practical Task**: Modify the previous loop to skip a number (using `continue`) or stop the loop early (using `break`).

---

### **Module 4: Functions in JavaScript**
#### Lesson 1: Function Basics
- Defining a function
- Function parameters and arguments
- Return statements

**Practical Task**: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

#### Lesson 2: Advanced Function Concepts
- Function expressions vs declarations
- Arrow functions (ES6)
- Scope (local vs global)

**Practical Task**: Convert regular functions to arrow functions and explore the behavior of local vs global variables.

---

### **Module 5: Objects and Arrays**
#### Lesson 1: Arrays
- Introduction to arrays
- Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, length, indexOf, etc.)
- Iterating over arrays (forEach, map)

**Practical Task**: Create an array of favorite movies and use methods to manipulate the list.

#### Lesson 2: Objects
- Object literals
- Accessing and modifying object properties
- Methods in objects

**Practical Task**: Create an object to represent a person with properties like `name`, `age`, and a method `greet`.

---

### **Module 6: The Document Object Model (DOM)**
#### Lesson 1: Introduction to the DOM
- What is the DOM?
- Accessing elements (getElementById, querySelector)
- Changing element content and styles

**Practical Task**: Create an HTML file with some elements and manipulate them using JavaScript.

#### Lesson 2: Event Handling
- Introduction to events (click, keypress, etc.)
- Adding event listeners
- The `this` keyword in event handlers

**Practical Task**: Create a button that changes the background color of a page when clicked.

---

### **Module 7: Error Handling and Debugging**
#### Lesson 1: Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks
- Throwing custom errors
- Finally statement

**Practical Task**: Write a script that catches and handles a potential error in user input (e.g., trying to parse a non-numeric value).

#### Lesson 2: Debugging Tools
- Using `console.log` for debugging
- The browser’s built-in debugger tool
- Setting breakpoints

**Practical Task**: Debug a script with an intentional error and correct it using the browser’s debugger.

---

### **Module 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**
#### Lesson 1: Introduction to OOP Concepts
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Classes and constructors (ES6 classes)
- Prototypes

**Practical Task**: Create a class `Car` with properties `make`, `model`, and a method `startEngine`.

#### Lesson 2: Inheritance in JavaScript
- Extending classes
- Using `super()`
- Overriding methods

**Practical Task**: Extend the `Car` class to create a `ElectricCar` class with a new method `chargeBattery`.

---

### **Module 9: Asynchronous JavaScript**
#### Lesson 1: Callbacks and Promises
- Synchronous vs asynchronous code
- Introduction to callbacks
- Promises and `.then()`

**Practical Task**: Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data) using `setTimeout` and handle it using callbacks and promises.

#### Lesson 2: Async/Await (ES7)
- The `async` keyword
- The `await` keyword
- Error handling in async functions

**Practical Task**: Refactor the previous lesson’s code to use `async`/`await`.

---

### **Module 10: Introduction to JavaScript APIs**
#### Lesson 1: Fetch API and AJAX
- What is an API?
- Fetching data from an API (using Fetch)
- Handling JSON responses

**Practical Task**: Fetch data from a public API (e.g., a weather API) and display the results on a web page.

#### Lesson 2: LocalStorage and SessionStorage
- Storing data in the browser
- Using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- Retrieving and deleting stored data

**Practical Task**: Create a to-do list that saves tasks in `localStorage` so they persist across page reloads.

## **Course Resources**
- **MDN Web Docs**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
- **JavaScript Info**: https://javascript.info/
- **W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial**: https://www.w3schools.com/js/

## **Assessment and Evaluation**
- **Quizzes**: At the end of each module, students will complete a short quiz to assess understanding.
- **Assignments**: Practical coding tasks will be assigned after every two lessons.
- **Final Project**: Students will complete a final project that combines many of the concepts learned throughout the course. Examples of final projects include:
  - Building a dynamic web page using DOM manipulation.
  - Creating a simple web application (e.g., a weather app, a calculator, or a to-do list).

## **Course Objectives**
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1. Understand and use basic and advanced JavaScript syntax.
2. Manipulate the DOM to create interactive web pages.
3. Use functions, objects, arrays, and OOP concepts to write reusable and maintainable code.
4. Handle asynchronous operations and work with external APIs.
5. Debug and handle errors in their JavaScript code.
